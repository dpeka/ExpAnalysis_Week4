# We have to look at the SCC file and figure out based on the levels

# We will use a regex: [Cc]oal & [Cc]omb
# Note - we get different results if we only look for coal (we get far more
# records).  I could not find clear documentation on knowing what are 
# Combustion / Coal only - so I am going conservative.
